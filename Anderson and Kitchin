Anderson described that human are in petabyte age, where most things are different. In petabyte age, many things can just be exaplained
by data and analysis, such as the example that Anderson gave in his article, "we don't know why ths page is better than the other,If the
statistics of incoming links say it is, that's good enough". Many methods that human used to be using has became obsolete, anderson stated
in his article. Google entirely relying on their stastistics for online advertisement and they achieved huge sccucess or even redfined the 
way of online advertisement. I would say I agree more with Anderson's opinion, because the world is constantly changing and keep obeying the
theories in the past may be unprogressive.
While Kitchin's theory is that most data derived from social media and consumer platforms is biased, but in my opinion as long as people can 
use methods to avoid biased analysis, it is feasible to get the accurate result without relying on changless theory. I think the world is 
constantly changing, espcially in nowadays, so I would agree more with Anderson's idea.
