**The Health Care system in Tibet and the Health Situation on Tibetan Plateau**



Problem Statement:

Tibet as an autonomous region located in far west part of China, is the home for more than 3million people in 2018 according to National Bureau of Statistics of China. Among the population, 90% made up of ethnic Tibetans. As a remote region from economic center in China, Tibet has the same symptom  to many other economically undeveloped areas in human development, that a mature and thorough health care system is absent. The problems on health care system for ethnical minorities living in the Tibetan plateau can be broken down in two parts. First, the accessibility of Health care for comparing to other parts of China. The significance of absence of a mature health care system is that Tibet became the number one in maternal morality rate in China and East Asia. The average life expectancy in Tibet Plateau is also much lower than other big cities in East coast of China. The inheritance of the problem has many explanation. Tibet Plateau has an altitude over 4500 meters and its mountainous terrain made communication to other areas difficult. The historic lack of economic development lost the attraction to resources allocation.

In the article,  Author Huhua Cao stated the significance of the problem of health care in Tibet, that the health and health care on the Tibetan Plateau are among the poorest in China. Author first compared and analyzed the problem from the economic perspective, the GDP per capita in rural Qinghai Province(part of Tibetan Plateau) was 3712 CNY in 2005 whereas China had an average of 9101 CNY in 2005. Author implied the problem in health care system was caused by the undeveloped economy in western China at some degree. Author then listed Human develop index and life expectancy on Tibetan Plateau and other areas in China, according to 2000 census, rural Tibet had a HDI of 0.599, versus China had an average HDI of 0.746. Author Cao pointed out the health care problems on Tibetan Plateau is relatively significant.  Tibetan women and infants are at high risk of birth-related deaths. Some other diseases common on Tibetan Plateau are diarrhea, arthritis and pneumonia, which vary in prevalence throughout the geographic area, it is also reported that the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) has the highest rate of tuberculosis in China, and one of the highest incidences in the world of the rare KashinBeck (Big Bone) disease, which causes deformities and stunted growth. 

In author opinion, low life expectancy in Tibetan Plateau was driven by many factors, such as poor nutrition, lack of trained health personnel and long travel distances, but the main reason is the accessibility to health care. The tradition of Tibetan society is that trained birth attendants does not exist, which makes it very hard for women to find help when they give birth. Central government of China economic development strategy for the vast western regions, only focus on large-scale infrastructure projects, such as roads, railways and power stations, while often neglecting ‘soft’ infrastructure such as the provision of health care and education. Adequate and affordable health care is still not available to the majority of Tibetans. Nowadays, the health care structure in rural areas of Qinghai province, and much of western China, is hierarchical: county hospital – township health centres – local clinics – village doctors. However, the village doctors as the backbones of health care system in west China is reportedly undertrained. "Village doctors (mostly men) who usually have between three to six months of training often after only several years of schooling, plus possibly two to three weeks of in-service training per year". Author suggested the way to solve the problems in his article. First is to improve the training of village doctors in the west, as well as improving health educations. Training of women health workers is also one of the priorities. In addition, establishment of more village clinic may indeed improve accessible health care provision for people living in remote areas in the west. However, the success will be depending on many things, the determination of people, enthusiasm etc..

This resource is a research paper that aims to study the health care system in Tibet, with a special focus on high mortality rate. Authors studied the government policies and regulations and retrieved data  from other published articles. Authors first pointed out the health care spending has been dramatically increasing since 2000. "Public health spending in Tibet increased 67-fold, the hospital delivery rate increased 70.1%, and the MMR dropped from 466.9 to 100.1 per 100,000 live births". Even the government spending has increased many times, the number of health workers including medical doctors, registered nurse are still much lower than the national average, respectively are only 4.4, 1.4 in 1,000 people. Nevertheless, the medical resources in Tibet area is also much lower than other areas in China. Author used an example of emergency obstetric care in Tibet. According to emergency obstetric care (EOC) criteria, "Tibet’s 74 county hospitals barely meet the standard of basic EOC. The prefecture (city) hospital and referral hospitals provide comprehensive EOC. Thus, there are about 12 EOC facilities and two comprehensive EOC for every 500,000 population, which merely meets the WHO’s minimum standard for EOC".([Labasangzhu](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Labasangzhu [Author]&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=30532605)) 

With that being said, Tibet did make its progress in maternal health. According to author's data, maternal mortality ratio(per 100,000people) in Tibet was 460 in year 2000 and sharply reduced to around 100 in 2010, which also came with a boost in hospital delivery rate. The numbers of antenatal care and postpartum care were boosted after year 2010. The progress was tie to the new insurance policies and government subsidies. China central government has issued policies to encourage women to give birth at hospital. In October 2015, Tibet HFPC launched a new regulation to promote hospital delivery in rural Tibet. According to the regulation, "every rural woman who gives birth at an appointed hospital receives 1,000 CNY as a living subsidy and 30 CNY per day if admitted to the hospital before the beginning of labor pain and 50 CNY for transportation".([Labasangzhu](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Labasangzhu [Author]&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=30532605)) The new insurance policy also helped at some level. "The current scheme is a voluntary insurance scheme with a mix of flat-rate household contributions and subsides from the central and the Tibet governments. Although project-based transportation and living subsidy were initiated in the early 2000s, hospital child delivery and subsidy for transportation were first included in the FHMS from 2006 with a maximum reimbursement limit. After 2012, the institutional childbirth fee exemption policy was universally implemented for all rural residents".(Labasangzhu) In conclusion, author recognized the improvement in Tibet health care the remarkable progress with continuous financial investment. However the shortage of health professionals and EOC centers should be fulfilled.

In this article, author provided us a unique scope in maternal delivery in Tibet, with a focus on how the traditional value and believes of Tibetan people conflict the modern medicine and delivering children at hospitals, and what Tibetan people think "having a safe delivery" is. Authors conducted a research of interviewing with women living on Tibetan plateau. The team was full of professionally trained personnel in ethnographic methods and semi-structured interview techniques. After data collection and thorough analysis, the team could find out some of the believes and customs that Tibetan people have in common. "Nearly all of the Tibetan rural women we interviewed, “having a safe delivery” involved doing a variety of things to protect oneself and the unborn fetus and, later, the newborn, from potential harm."(Adams) The traditional believes in Tibetan people that prevent them from delivering children in hospital can be classified into three category: spirit, pollution and diet. 

Most of Tibetan people believe spirit is one of the most important things out of a person, and they are actively engaging in animism. Deities can be recruited to help the natural environment or, conversely, can become angered by being offended, which will cause some misfortunes such as natural disasters or loss of wealth, property or even human life. In their believes, infants are even more vulnerable to spirit attacks. They are “closer” to the world of the intermediate state. "The fear of spirit entities often translates into rural women’s suspicion of delivering in locations where there are strangers, such as clinics or hospitals."(Adams) Pollution is another major concern for Tibetan people delivery in hospitals. Most Tibetans believe in pollution which particular refers to the blood of childbirth, and the blood of death animals, is a form of spiritual contamination. Therefore, most Tibetan people are reluctant to have birth helpers, in order to avoid them to be exposed to the blood of childbirth. There are only few individuals might be trusted to help at a birth—husbands, mothers-in-law, or other female relatives. however, they will avoid cleaning the knife or other tools that were used to cut the cord until after it has been used. Lastly, Tibetan people believe that what to eat during pregnancy are constrained by limited types of food. "After a child is born, many women feel it is necessary to put butter on the fontanel in order to protect the child from spirit attacks, and also to put a pat of butter on the tongue to ensure that the baby would be blessed with good speech and intelligence".(Adam) So that, feeding infants certain amounts of butter and flour after birth is considered the key component of “having a safe delivery.” Most Tibetan interviewees strongly believed in that even though that may be in conflict with a “best practices” biomedical approach of modern medicine. From their research result, we can conclude that the traditional believes in Tibetan people is in conflict with modern medicine in many ways, and the high maternal mortality rate in Tibetan Plateau is relatively related to that.

In this article, authors studied the situation of nutritional and heal status for children at high altitudes on Tibet plateau. People usually think children living at high altitudes have delayed growth, Tibet which has the highest altitude in China and relatively low average height for teenagers has drawn more and more international attentions. With that being said, whether growth retardation is related to altitude or to other factors is unknown. After a series of thorough research and data analysis, author concluded that stun growing was not associated with altitude. For children living on Tibetan plateau, severe stunting is due to malnutrition which usually happened early in life. Author found evidence of substantial malnutrition among Tibetan children. According to author's data, "over 50 percent of the children they examined had moderate-to-severe stunting of growth. The proportion of children with stunted growth was greater in nonurban areas than in urban areas". (Nancy S Harris) The natural assumption is that children living in urban area usually have more varieties of food and better nutrition, whereas nonurban area in Tibet does not have the same. Even children who lived in villages were represented in many different altitude groups, the researchers found no association between altitude and stunting, which indicates that the altitude is not the significant determining factor for children growth failure. Nevertheless, children who live in nonurban areas were facing other problems too. According to data, "children in nonurban areas were significantly more likely than those in urban areas to have depigmented hair, abdominal distention, skin lesions, goiter, and a maternal history of goiter."(Nancy S Harris) By author's analysis, we could have a better scope on the situation of children who live in nonurban areas on Tibetan Plateau. In many ways, they have clinical signs of malnutrition as well as other symptoms. These problems will not only cause delayed growing in height, but put children living on Tibetan Plateau a high risk of death. The adjustment in policy and a significant improvement for children living in nonurban areas is no time to delay.

In the article, author researched the contemporary Tibetan medical practices in rural area from socio-economic dimensions, evaluate the value of traditional Tibetan medicine under the influence of  mainstream biomedicine and assessed how the Tibetan medicine impacts Tibetan residents and medical professionals nowadays. Author firstly defined Tibetan medicine, which is "the inheritor of what in Tibetan has been traditionally referred to as Sowa Rigpa or ‘Science of Healing’",(Theresia Hofer) it is largely available and accessible in big cities such as Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet autonomous Region, but it is hard to have access and to be able to afford in rural areas on the contrary.

In the rural areas, the main Tibetan medical care providers are mainly private doctors. However, the current health insurance provided to Tibetan people (CMS) does not have policy to cover practices from private doctors. As compared to biomedicine, which is reimbursed by the CMS insurance scheme, Tibetan medicine provided by private doctors appears expensive and is often unaffordable. Which makes the demand for traditional Tibetan medicine largely decreased. However, private doctors heavily rely on the monetary income from their medical work in order to make a living. It has became a negative feedback loop, private doctors do not receive enough amount of money, that made young graduates "give up" their path, accelerate the disappearing of traditional Tibetan medicine. Author argued reasonability of the CMS scheme which is currently only reimbursing biomedical care, together with a steady increase in the price of Tibetan medicines. With the invasion of western medicine-the biomedicine, the future of traditional Tibetan medicine in rural Tibet is precarious. "While certain aspects of Tibetan medicine expand and become more widely available in urban settings in Tibet, China and abroad, it is increasingly difficult for doctors to practice solely and competently Tibetan medicine in the rural areas of the TAR, and to afford and access Tibetan medical treatment as a patient"(Theresia Hofer)
