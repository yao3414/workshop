**Geospatial Data Methods for monitoring accessibility of health care in rural China**

â€‹														Di Yao

Introduction.

Accessibility to health care has been an insidious problem for people living in rural China for decades. Health care facilities in rural areas are generally equipped with less qualified workforce and provide less comprehensive services compared to secondary or tertiary hospitals, which are mostly concentrated in urban areas  Far away from the local economic and political center,  suburban areas where lacks appropriate medical equipment and relative knowledge, means the impossibility for economic disadvantaged patients with severe illness to receive proper treatments, thus bringing life expectancy in rural area far lower than that in  big cities in East coast of China.  Even though the situation of accessibility to health care in rural parts of China has been improving, it still has not met people's need yet. Many of the problems like personal economic hardship, underdeveloped  local social security and inferior infrastructure were still there contributing to the problem. Thus, a sustainable development is needed, which economic and political policies have to be used in combine in order to relieve the aforementioned problems as well as to provide a sustainable and efficient improvement in the overall health care accessibility . 



Inquiry Type

The big research topic of my paper is health care accessibility in rural China. And the topic is explanatory as it explains the situation of health care accessibility in rural China and  depicted the evolve and improvement over years. The central research question aims to identify specific causes of low life expectancy and health care accessibility in rural China, by measuring the health care quality to predict the overall access to health care. The big research question was further broken down into many sub questions in order to help studying, such as the maternal morality rate in rural Tibet and the relationship between health care quality and human development index.



Methodology

### The E2SFCA method

In the article "Spatial accessibility of hospital care in Sichuan China",  a method called E2SFCA (enhanced two-step floating catchment area) was introduced to measure the spatial accessibility for health care system in Sichuan China.  The method was divided into a few steps. The first step is to calculate the supply-to-demand ratio R of every hospital.  (*S**j*) in the equation shows the medical capacity of each hospital which is shared by the population in the nearby areas. d represents the travel cost where *j* and *k* indicates the start off point and destination, *D**r* is the *r*th sub-zone based on travel time, *W**r* is a distance-weight for *D**r*, which is based on a distance decay function. Inverse power function will be used in order to calculate the equation(Gaussian function)

 The second step is to calculate the spatial accessibility *A**i**F* of each population unit *i* through equation 2. *R**k* is the supply-to-demand ratio of hospital *k*, and hospital site *k* falls in different sub-zones of population unit *i* is given different *W**r* values as in the first step. The equation was listed below.

Using the equation, the researchers could conclude a result shows as below. In Sichuan, the accessibility of healthcare in region of ethnic minority is far worse than that in non-minority region in terms of the expense and time to hospitals and the value of spatial accessibility. The inequality in the accessibility to doctors and health professionals, revealed in the analysis below, is greater than in accessing to hospital beds. Comparing to non-minority region, in ethnic minority region,  the intensity of primary, secondary, and tertiary hospitals is comparably loose and the balance among these hospitals, as well as between public and private hospitals, is obviously less even.  The disparity within ethnic minority region is larger than in non-minority region.

#### Nighttime Lights and Electrification Rates method

In the article " Using Nighttime Satellite Imagery as a Proxy Measure of Human Well-Being", the electrified rate was used as an indicator of quality of life.  researchers used electrified rate to access people's accessibility to health care services and others standards of life. In the article, the percent electrification rate was then calculated as:

The DMSP-OLS nighttime lights imagery in combination with the LandScan population grid have been used to measure electrification rates as an indicator of quality of life. The result of using nighttime lights  was showed below.

 The aggregation was done at the national and the sub-national level. The total number of people found to be without electricity was 1.62 billion, only about 2.5 percent larger than the 1.58 billion estimated by the International Energy agency. The electrification rates for the countries as estimated from the DMSP nighttime lights were in an overall agreement with the IEA electrification rates. Developed countries for which IEA reported near 100 percent electrification rates, yielded DMSP estimated electrification rates ranging from 98 to 100 percent, which means they have a very high quality of life as well as accessibility to health care services. The countries for which the DMSP estimated electrification rates were less than 20 percent are some of the poorest countries in the world, which means the accessibility to health care services is relatively low.





**Discussion**

The methods I used in answering my research questions were mostly efficient and useful. The first methodology measures the spatial accessibility for health care services in Sichuan China and the article directly answered my research question. However, in the article, researchers used a handful of data sources that were collected many years ago, so the accuracy is doubtful, which they can make an improvement on. The second methodology combined nighttime lights and landscan population grid to measure the electrified rate in order to access the quality of life in certain areas. The limitation on this article is that it lack of a very specific focus on rural or under developed areas so it couldn't answer my research question to the utmost extent.
