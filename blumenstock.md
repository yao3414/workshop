# Blumenstock Response

What is the promise of data science?

On theory, big data and data science did or have the potential to transform the international development and many other areas, for example, data scientist found the exisiting relationship between number of international phone calls and the likelyhood of paying debts; or the algorithms that big companies are using can also be used to detect poverty. With all these methods, people can better target who is in need and where they are going to aid. 

What are the pitfalls of data science?

There are pitfalls in using of big data. First, using big data can cause some unanticipated effects, such as producing unwanted outcomes which results in citizens not getting benefits from the technology, or big data can be used as a tool to punish those who commited wrongdoings. Furthermore, data science is somehow lack of validation according to blumenstock. Blumenstock stated that conventional data collection methods in international development are imperfect while the new approachese also have flaws. One of the worrying is that algorithm is lack of accuracy. For example, once people are aware of that their digital data are being monitored to maked decision, they will game the system. With that being said, sometimes, even the algorithm itself is biased. For example, any decisions made based on google maps or other nevigation apps will allocate resources to those wealtheir people who have smartphones. Another problem is lack of regulation for data and data abusing.
